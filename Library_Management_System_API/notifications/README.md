## Notfications

This function of the app is to use the API calls included in the project to send the customer notifications when:
1. A book checked-out is due the next day
2. Upon a user signing up for "back in stock" alerts on specific books they were not able to get because they were already cheacked out. The user would then be alerted when a book has been returned amd thus available again.
